TicTacToe game test in Ruby
First I added winning combinations 
Then I created a method for gameplay with turn_sequence method which handle position choices and switching participant's turns 
Then there's a need for a method to check the board of array vs the winning combination; the code needs to check if there's a winner
If there is no winner when all the board positions are filled I need a method for no winner
Then I wanted to create a method if the particpants wanted to play again
I wanted to create a class where the participants get to write their name and are greeted 
One of the important parts of the game was to create a class for the board, display the board, update the board and an array which creates a board 
I need a method for updating the board array of "X" or "O" 
I needed a method to display an updated board after each turn
